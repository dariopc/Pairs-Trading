# Pairs Trading System

This repository contains the implementation of a pairs trading system. The project employs object-oriented programming techniques to create a scalable and efficient system for identifying and trading on mean-reverting opportunities in financial markets.
Project Overview

Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that involves identifying two highly correlated financial instruments, taking offsetting positions when their price spread deviates, and closing the trade when prices revert. This system is designed to streamline the entire workflow for pairs trading, including:
Historical stock data retrieval.
Statistical analysis for pair selection (cointegration tests).
Signal generation based on Z-scores.
Trade execution and portfolio performance tracking.
The system demonstrates consistent returns under controlled conditions and explores computational optimizations to improve efficiency.
